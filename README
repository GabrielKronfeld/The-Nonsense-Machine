This is a repository for pseudo-random messages to be posted at a regular interval. 
This may have many uses from obfuscation to befuddlement and more. 
Currently experimental but functional, this is a child repository controlled by the git-de-metricsizer repo.
Any works posted here should not be presumed to be human-readable.
